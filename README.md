# Foreign Exchange
This application utilizes html, css, bootstrap, javascript, jquery, Node.js, sequelize, mysql, handlebars.js, RESTful, and Microsoft's Translation API. The end result is an application that allows users to critique the machine translation given by Microsoft, vote on which translations are most accurate, and search for terms in many language so that people can learn the proper way of speaking in another language.
